# simpleAdding
Day 3 of #100daysofcode - Challenge 5 from Coderbyte - Simple Adding

This was an easier one for me! I was happy that I didn't have to google anything to figure it out -  a simple for loop with addition was all I needed.
I will try focus on more modern syntax for Javascript in future challenges if I can.
